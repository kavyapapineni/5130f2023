Comparing Recommendations Made by Online Systems and Friends


Abstract:

This research examined six online recommender systems for books and movies, including popular platforms like Amazon.com and RatingZone. The study compared the recommendations made by these systems to those suggested by users' friends. Surprisingly, friends consistently provided better recommendations than the online systems. However, users still found the items suggested by these systems useful because they were often unique and unexpected. In contrast, friends' recommendations mainly reminded users of their existing interests. The study also evaluated how easy these systems were to use. Users were willing to give more information to the systems if it meant getting better suggestions. Additionally, users trusted a system more if it recommended things they had liked before. This research sheds light on the effectiveness of online recommender systems and how people perceive recommendations from their friends and these platforms.
