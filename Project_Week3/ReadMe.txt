THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

Week 3 Progress Summary: 
During the third week of the project, our main objective was to enhance the functionality of our application by integrating The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

Integration of TMDB API:
We were able to effectively incorporate the TMDB API into our application to gain access to a substantial database of movie information.
acquiring up-to-date details about various films, including their title, genre, release date, and other information.

Update Store with Movies Data:
To properly handle the movie data that was retrieved, we made modifications to our application's state management system, which typically uses a store (like Redux). 

Movie Slice Creation: 
To further streamline the processing of data related to movies, we created a unique "movie slice" within our state management system. 

Main Container and Secondary Container Planning: 
We began organizing the main container and secondary containersÂ layouts in advance of the movie information being displayed on the HOME page. The movie data must be arranged and presented in a user-friendly manner, which requires these containers.

Obtaining Information for Trailer Videos: 
We began implementing the capability to obtain trailer videos for each movie, along with the usual movie data.One way this function improves the user experience is by allowing users to see trailers directly from the app.

Tasks I have DONE:
Displaying MovieCards with Posters:Displaying MovieCards with posters is a significant visual enhancement. This step not only makes your application more engaging but also provides users with a quick and visually appealing overview of the available movies. The integration of movie posters from the TMDB API adds a professional and aesthetic touch to your application.
