THE AI FILM FACTORY:

We've set up the basics of our project by adding styles and layout for Sign Up and Sign In pages using Tailwind and unique CSS. Now, we're working on making user login and registration secure using Google Firebase. 

We're also planning to show detailed movie information from TMDB API on our homepage. This will make our app more enjoyable and functional for users who love movies. We want to create a simple and user-friendly platform for movie enthusiasts.

The project is still at an elementary level, and we, as a group, are proud of the knowledge we acquired when we researched TMDB movie database and the API plugins configuration.
