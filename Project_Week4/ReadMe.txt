THE AI FILM FACTORY : 

Week 4 Progress Summary:

The main objective of this task was to incorporate the popular, highly rated, and upcoming movies into the application. This is our main goal for the fourth week of the project. This meant obtaining data from relevant APIs, processing it, and then deftly integrating it into the user interface.

Created a simple and clear user interface for the ChatGPT search bar.

Created a toggle function that seamlessly flips the user interface between the search bar and the home page was the aim of this task. This feature allows users to quickly navigate between the application's various sections.

Tasks I have DONE:

Implemented a toggle function which allows users to seamlessly switch between the home page and the search bar, enhancing navigation across different sections of the application. With this feature, users can easily transition between various components of the interface, providing a smooth and efficient user experience. The toggle function acts as a dynamic switch, facilitating quick navigation and improving the overall usability of the application.
